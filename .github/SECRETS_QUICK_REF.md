gh secret set DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME -b "johnrcumming001"
echo "YOUR_DOCKER_TOKEN" | gh secret set DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN

# Set GCP secret
gh secret set GCP_CREDENTIALS < /path/to/service-account.json
```

## Test the Workflow

Trigger a test build:
```bash
# Commit the workflow file
git add .github/workflows/docker-build-push.yml
git commit -m "Add Docker build and push workflow"
git push

# Or trigger manually
gh workflow run docker-build-push.yml
```

Monitor at: https://github.com/johnrcumming/DyLoRA-MoE/actions

## Expected Results

âœ… **On Success:**
- Images pushed to both registries
- Tagged with git hash and `latest`
- Available at:
  - `us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/dylora/dy-lora-training-repo/dy-lora-training-image:latest`
  - `johnrcumming001/dylora-moe:latest`

## Troubleshooting

| Error | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| "Unable to authenticate to Docker Hub" | Regenerate token at hub.docker.com/settings/security |
| "Failed to authenticate to GCP" | Check JSON is valid & service account exists |
| "Permission denied to Artifact Registry" | Grant `roles/artifactregistry.writer` to service account |
| Workflow not triggering | Check file paths in workflow match your changes |
