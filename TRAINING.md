# Training the DyLoRA-MoE Model

This document outlines the recommended strategy for training the **DyLoRA-MoE** model, as described in the [Technical Paper](DyLoRA%20-%20Technical%20Paper.md). The training process is designed to be a continual learning lifecycle, allowing the model to acquire new skills without forgetting existing ones.

## The Skill Acquisition Lifecycle

The process of learning a new skill is a multi-stage lifecycle managed by the architecture's components.

### 1. Novelty Detection

The system continuously processes a stream of data. The novelty detection module identifies a subset of data as out-of-distribution, signaling a new task for which the model has no specialized skill.

The current implementation uses a router confidence-based novelty detector. When the entropy of the router's output distribution exceeds a certain threshold, the data is flagged as novel. This indicates that the router is uncertain about which expert to choose, suggesting a new skill.

### 2. LoRA Expert Instantiation

A new, randomly initialized LoRA expert is created and integrated into the model's expert pool. This is handled by the `ExpertManager` class.

### 3. Few-Shot, High-Rate Seeding

The new LoRA expert is trained exclusively on the few available examples of the new skill. This initial training phase should use a **high learning rate** governed by an adaptive scheduler, such as a cyclical or warmup-stable-decay schedule. The goal is not immediate convergence but to rapidly move the expert's parameters into a competent region of the loss landscape.

### 4. Low-Rate Consolidation

As more data for the skill is encountered over time, the expert is further trained using a **low, stable learning rate**. This allows the model to fine-tune its parameters and converge to a robust solution, avoiding the instability associated with high learning rates.

### 5. Router Adaptation and Specialization

The router is trained in parallel with the experts.

-   **Dense Collaboration:** Initially, it learns to apply the **dense collaboration** strategy for the new skill's data. This involves routing the input to multiple experts and combining their outputs.
-   **Sparse Delegation:** As the expert undergoes consolidation, the router's training objective shifts to favor a **sparse delegation** policy. This involves routing the input to a single, specialized expert.

## Implementation with the Hugging Face Trainer

The `main.py` script now implements a continual learning loop that simulates a continuous stream of data, with new skills being introduced over time. The `TwoPhaseLRScheduler` is used to implement the high-rate seeding and low-rate consolidation phases, and the `DynamicHybridRouter` switches between dense and sparse routing based on the maturity of the experts.

## Proof-of-Concept Training Plan

This section outlines a smaller, more focused training plan to prove the concept of DyLoRA.

### 1. Foundational Skill: Python Programming

The first phase will focus on building a foundational understanding of Python.

**Training Dataset:**

*   **Dataset:** A curated subset of the **Code Alpaca** dataset, filtered to only include Python code.
*   **Objective:** Train a single LoRA expert on this dataset to serve as the "base" Python expert.

### 2. Continual Skill Acquisition: Web Scraping with `requests`

The second phase will introduce a new, distinct skill: web scraping with the `requests` library.

**Training Dataset:**

*   **Dataset:** A small, targeted dataset of Python code snippets that use the `requests` library for web scraping. This dataset can be generated using a large language model like Gemini.
*   **Objective:** Train a new LoRA expert on this dataset to teach the model the new skill.

### 3. Evaluation

*   **Foundational Skill:** Evaluate the model's ability to solve basic Python programming problems using the **MBPP (Mostly Basic Python Problems)** dataset.
*   **New Skill:** Evaluate the model's ability to solve web scraping problems using a custom evaluation dataset.
*   **Forgetting:** Evaluate the model's performance on the MBPP dataset after learning the new skill to ensure that it has not forgotten the foundational knowledge.

This proof-of-concept training plan will allow us to validate the core principles of the DyLoRA-MoE architecture in a more controlled and efficient manner.

## Detailed Training Plan for Software Development Excellence

This section outlines a comprehensive, phased plan to train a DyLoRA-MoE model to excel at software development tasks.

### Phase 1: Foundational Model Selection and Initial Training

The goal of this phase is to establish a strong baseline of general coding knowledge.

**1. Foundation Model Selection:**

*   **Model:** We will use a powerful, open-source foundation model such as **Llama 3** or **Mistral Large**. The choice will be based on a combination of performance on coding benchmarks and compatibility with the `peft` library.
*   **Size:** We will start with a 7B or 8B parameter model to balance performance and training cost.

**2. Foundational Training Dataset:**

*   **Primary Dataset:** A curated subset of **The Stack** (v1.2 or newer), focusing on high-quality code from a variety of languages, including Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C++, and Go.
*   **Instruction Tuning Dataset:** A mixture of **Code Alpaca** and **Open-Orca** to teach the model to follow instructions and reason about code.
*   **Data Mixture Ratio:** We will use a ratio of 80% code from The Stack and 20% instruction-tuning data.

**3. Initial Training:**

*   **Objective:** Train a single, general-purpose LoRA expert on the foundational dataset. This expert will serve as the "base" expert that all other experts will be built upon.
*   **Training Time:** This will be the longest phase of training, lasting for several weeks on a multi-GPU setup.
*   **Learning Rate:** We will use a cosine learning rate schedule with a warmup period.

### Phase 2: Continual Skill Acquisition with Gemini-Generated Data

This phase will focus on teaching the model a variety of specialized software development skills.

**1. Skill Definition and Data Generation:**

We will use Gemini to generate a continuous stream of high-quality, targeted training data for the following skills:

*   **API Integration:**
    *   **Stripe:** Generating code to process payments, manage subscriptions, and handle webhooks.
    *   **Twilio:** Generating code to send and receive SMS messages, make phone calls, and manage video calls.
    *   **Google Maps:** Generating code to display maps, geocode addresses, and calculate directions.
*   **Framework-Specific Development:**
    *   **React:** Generating code for building user interfaces, managing state, and handling events.
    *   **Django:** Generating code for building web applications, defining models, and creating views.
    *   **Flask:** Generating code for building lightweight web applications and APIs.
*   **Cloud Deployment:**
    *   **AWS:** Generating IaC scripts (Terraform, CloudFormation) and SDK usage examples (Boto3) for deploying applications to EC2, S3, and Lambda.
    *   **Google Cloud:** Generating IaC scripts and SDK usage examples for deploying applications to Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, and Cloud Functions.
    *   **Azure:** Generating IaC scripts and SDK usage examples for deploying applications to Virtual Machines, Blob Storage, and Functions.
*   **Database Management:**
    *   **PostgreSQL:** Generating SQL queries and code to interact with PostgreSQL using libraries like `psycopg2`.
    *   **MongoDB:** Generating queries and code to interact with MongoDB using libraries like `pymongo`.
    *   **Redis:** Generating code to use Redis for caching, session management, and real-time messaging.

**2. Continual Learning Loop:**

The `main.py` script will be modified to simulate a continuous stream of data, with new skills being introduced over time. For each new skill:

*   **Novelty Detection:** The router confidence-based novelty detector will identify the new skill.
*   **Expert Instantiation:** A new LoRA expert will be created.
*   **Two-Phase Training:** The `TwoPhaseLRScheduler` will be used to train the new expert, with a high learning rate for the first few epochs and a low learning rate for the remaining epochs.
*   **Router Adaptation:** The router will be trained in parallel to learn to route inputs to the new expert.
*   **Expert Maturity Update:** Once the new expert is trained, its maturity will be updated so that the router can switch to sparse delegation.

### Phase 3: Evaluation

A robust evaluation framework will be used to track the model's performance.

**1. Evaluation Datasets:**

*   **HumanEval and MBPP:** Used to evaluate the model's general-purpose coding ability.
*   **Custom Evaluation Datasets:** For each specialized skill, we will create a custom evaluation dataset with a variety of real-world problems. For example, for the Stripe API skill, we will create a dataset of problems that require the model to generate code to create a new customer, process a payment, and handle a webhook.

**2. Evaluation Framework:**

*   **Automated Evaluation:** We will use `pass@k` and code BLEU to track the model's performance on the evaluation datasets.
*   **Human Evaluation:** We will use a team of software engineers to evaluate the quality of the model's generated code and its ability to solve real-world problems.

### Phase 4: Integration with Weights & Biases (wandb)

We will use Weights & Biases to track our experiments and visualize the model's performance.

*   **Logging:** We will log the following metrics to wandb:
    *   Loss
    *   Learning rate
    *   `pass@k` on the evaluation datasets
    *   Code BLEU on the evaluation datasets
    *   Number of active experts
    *   Router entropy
*   **Dashboards:** We will create dashboards in wandb to visualize the model's performance over time and compare the performance of different experts.
*   **Artifacts:** We will store model checkpoints and evaluation results as artifacts in wandb.

## Current Status

**Status:** Ready for Execution

The necessary code infrastructure is in place to begin the training plan. The `prepare_data.py` script is configured to download and load the required datasets using the Hugging Face `datasets` library, and the `main.py` script is set up to run the continual learning loop with Weights & Biases integration.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Set up a cloud GPU:** The local hardware is not sufficient to train this model. You will need to set up a cloud GPU instance on a platform like Google Cloud, AWS, or Azure. A machine with a single NVIDIA A100 or H100 GPU should be sufficient for the proof-of-concept.
2.  **Set up the environment:** Once you have a cloud GPU instance, you will need to clone the repository, create a virtual environment, and install the required dependencies.
3.  **Launch Training:** Run the `main.py` script to begin the training process.
4.  **Monitor Training:** Monitor the training process and results using the Weights & Biases dashboard.
