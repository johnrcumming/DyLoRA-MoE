# Training DyLoRA-MoE on Vertex AI

This document outlines the plan for training the DyLoRA-MoE model on Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform. Using Vertex AI will allow us to leverage powerful, managed infrastructure to scale our training and experimentation.

## 1. Environment Setup

### 1.1. Google Cloud Project

*   **Create a new Google Cloud Project:** If you don't already have one, create a new project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
*   **Enable APIs:** Enable the following APIs for your project:
    *   Vertex AI API
    *   Cloud Storage API
    *   Artifact Registry API
    *   Cloud Build API
*   **Create a Service Account:** Create a service account with the following roles:
    *   Vertex AI User
    *   Storage Object Admin
    *   Artifact Registry Writer
*   **Authenticate:** Authenticate your local environment with your service account credentials.

### 1.2. Cloud Storage

*   **Create a Cloud Storage Bucket:** Create a new Cloud Storage bucket to store your training data, model artifacts, and other assets.

## 2. Code Packaging

### 2.1. Dockerize the Training Application

*   **Create a `Dockerfile`:** Create a `Dockerfile` in the root of the project to package the training application. This will include:
    *   A base image with Python and CUDA pre-installed (e.g., `python:3.10-slim`).
    *   Copying the project files into the container.
    *   Installing the required dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
*   **Build and Push the Container:** Use Cloud Build to build the Docker image and push it to Artifact Registry.

## 3. Training Job Submission

### 3.1. Create a Training Script

*   **Create a Python script:** Create a new Python script (e.g., `vertex_training.py`) to submit the training job to Vertex AI. This script will use the `google-cloud-aiplatform` SDK to:
    *   Define a `CustomTrainingJob`.
    *   Specify the custom container image from Artifact Registry.
    *   Configure the machine type and GPU requirements (e.g., `n1-standard-8` with an NVIDIA A100 GPU).
    *   Define the command to run the training script within the container.
    *   Submit the training job.

### 3.2. Run the Training Job

*   **Execute the script:** Run the `vertex_training.py` script to submit the training job to Vertex AI.

## 4. Monitoring and Evaluation

### 4.1. Vertex AI Experiments

*   **Track Experiments:** Use Vertex AI Experiments to track the training job, including the parameters, metrics, and artifacts.
*   **Monitor Logs:** Monitor the training logs in the Google Cloud Console to track the progress of the training job and identify any issues.

### 4.2. Weights & Biases

*   **Integrate with wandb:** Continue to use the existing Weights & Biases integration to log detailed metrics and visualize the model's performance.

## 5. Next Steps

*   **Implement the `Dockerfile`:** Create the `Dockerfile` to package the training application.
*   **Implement the `vertex_training.py` script:** Create the script to submit the training job to Vertex AI.
*   **Run a test job:** Run a small test job on Vertex AI to ensure that the entire pipeline is working correctly.
*   **Launch the full training:** Once the test job is successful, launch the full training job on a powerful GPU instance.
