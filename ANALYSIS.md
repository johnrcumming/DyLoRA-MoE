## 2. Training Performance Analysis

### 2.1 Current Training Issues

#### ✅ **LoRA Gradient Flow Analysis - RESOLVED**
**Finding**: LoRA A matrices show zero gradients initially, while LoRA B matrices show normal gradient flow (20-250 norm range).

**Resolution**: This is **mathematically correct and expected behavior** for LoRA initialization:
- LoRA B matrices are zero-initialized (by design in PEFT)
- LoRA A matrices are randomly initialized  
- LoRA output = B @ A @ x * scaling
- Since B = 0 initially: LoRA contribution = 0, therefore ∂(loss)/∂(A) = 0
- B matrices receive gradients: ∂(loss)/∂(B) = ∂(loss)/∂(output) * (A @ x) ≠ 0
- Once B becomes non-zero through training, A matrices will receive gradients

**Impact**: 
- This is correct LoRA behavior, not a bug
- Training efficiency is actually optimal in early phases
- A matrices will engage as B matrices develop non-zero values

#### ⚠️ **Training Stability Issues**
**Evidence**: 30 training runs with all recent 5 runs failing
- Run failure pattern suggests systematic issues
- High initial loss values (21-22) indicating poor initialization
- Gradient norms in scientific notation (e-12 range) suggest numerical instability

### 2.2 Successful Training Evidence

#### ✅ **Basic Functionality Confirmed**
- Model instantiation works correctly
- Forward pass produces expected output shapes
- Gradient computation succeeds for LoRA B matrices
- Loss calculation and backpropagation functional

#### ✅ **Parameter Efficiency Metrics**
- **Total Parameters**: 311 parameters tracked in the model wrapper
- **Trainable Parameters**: 74 (23.8% of total)
